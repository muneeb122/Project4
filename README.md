Your repository must include a README.md file that clearly shows us:

what your name is,
what your project does, concisely
how to run your project


**Overview**

* Muneeb Hameed
* Option 1

This project scrapes data from the National Parks website for each state and outputs in a CSV information about the type of site, the name of the site, a short description of the site, and the location(s) of the site.

**Running the application**<br>
In order to run the application, the user must first install everything included in requirements.txt.
Then the user must run the SI507_project4 file by going into the containing directory within the terminal and typing in 'python3 SI507_project3.py'

Running this file will create a CSV file called npsinfo2.csv where the user can find the information scraped.
